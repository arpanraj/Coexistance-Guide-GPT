0. The first question that emerged was -
How can the origin of the world and the living beings from Brahman Truth be false?
other question -
How is Brahma the cause of bondage and salvation?
Third question -
Word proof or word holder carrier proof?
Evidence of object sentence or evidence of origin of object sentence?
Scriptural evidence or pioneer evidence?
Another question arose in the expedient situation
Fourth question -

After independence in India, the Constituent Assembly was formed in which
The formula of nation, nationality and national character is not explained.
The acceptance of being eligible to be a public representative should be in the Constitution.

Mandate and public representatives from Vote-Note (Dhan) alliance
How ?

Secularism in the Constitution - one sentence and many others along with it
Mention of caste, sect, community.

Equality in the Constitution - one sentence, along with that of reservation
To be mentioned and processed.

Democracy – Vote in the election process of public representatives in governance

What kind of democracy, equality and secularism is this?
