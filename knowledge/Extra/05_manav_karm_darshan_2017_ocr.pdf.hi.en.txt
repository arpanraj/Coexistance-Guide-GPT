Power is intermediary, comprehensive. In power nature is odd and even and mediating action,
is limited. Therefore the power position is complete.

The inanimate and animate nature is present in the being, hence nature is included in the being.
Therefore, nature is imbued with power. Therefore, nature is complete in power, that is why nature
Is completely full of energy. Therefore, nature is active. Therefore, nature labor, motion and
Is consequential. As a result, nature itself is visible in four states. therefore in power
The ability to experience the conscious nature from the complete inanimate nature in a state of knowledge,
The opportunity to be accomplished with capability and eligibility is appropriate and all four stages are related to each other.
Perfection is contracted in the sense of completeness.

Power is the mediator. Therefore, the complete nature is controlled and protected in the intermediary power.
The center (nucleus) found in every atom is the mediator. Therefore even-
Contrasting actions and relative forces are controlled and protected.

Infinite action or group of actions is nature itself, which exists in the form of matter and consciousness.
Is countable. It is the destiny of inanimate nature itself to attain the state of consciousness after complete development.
Is full of. Man is a combined form of matter and consciousness and is also a part of nature.

In the course of development, completeness is the only thing. In the course of development/awakening, the only thing is awakening in confused human beings.
Action is perfection and conduct is perfection. Awakened human dealing with less developed nature
Good use in business nurtures usefulness. human with human
It is a responsibility to be proud with behavior, more awakened and for more awakened

Only the confused human being is independent while doing the work and dependent while enjoying the fruits.

Human awakening is in order on this earth. He has the opportunity, desire and
The possibility is available. Its main purpose is for the awakened human being to help the less developed ones.

, Atomic structure and molecular structure
The desire to understand the atomic structure has been present in humans since the distant past.

Humans thought, thought and experimented to reach the original object through decomposition method.
At the end of the disintegration, the expectation of some definite original object also remained.

While experimenting with the above mentality, man came to the conclusion that
If we keep on disintegrating the object then we will reach a situation where the disintegrated units
It makes sense that it works automatically. We call such a working unit nuclear
They say. The human desire to understand how it all works has persisted.

One or more particles in the center of the atom and rotating in the surroundings all around it
There is an arrangement of having one or more fractions. There can be no talk of nuclear in anything less than this. Middle
Or if the number of particles increases in the environment, it comes to human imagination.

In this context two main questions came to mind - How to identify atomic fractions in reciprocity
Could you make it? 2. Why did they become part of the system after being identified? On taking this idea forward
It was understood that coexistence is the main reason for this, because all things are energy.
Every single object is immersed, wet and surrounded. The broader object transcends all of these. Thus
Energy rich on the basis of completeness of smallest and largest units in the larger one.
It became clear to stay. Having force richness and magnetic force richness only due to energy richness
Makes sense. It is due to this power that we can recognize the interconnectedness of microscopic atomic parts and
There is a tendency to participate in the system. The identity of each other is proof of this force.
To be accepted as human it is necessary to be human. human tendency, work, function
Is endowed with the innate right to recognize. In this sequence, when humans recognize each other
They present themselves there only in the form of a system. Wherever this meaning is recognized
They keep making mistakes in their work, behave in a disorganized manner and cause problems.
Are. In this way it is understood that each atomic fragment (being enriched in
Based on) are working in the system as a result of recognizing each other. of arrangement

The form of action is definite conduct.

In this way, as a result of each atomic particle being full of energy, it also binds to each other.
It is natural to recognize, the purpose of this recognition is to behave jointly, it
Understood as an eternal law. It also follows from this that such identification
The formation-organization should be based on this and the formation-organization should be certified in the sense of the system.
Being is ever present. In this way, all the individual things are indivisible in the comprehensive thing.
Being and understanding it as coexistence has become easier. coexistence in this order
Being influenced daily is acceptable to us humans.

Co-existence became the basic formula and basis of the system. Every situation is at the root of motion
Coexistence is clear. In this way, coexistence is the various functions (actions), their respective
It became clear that there was a basis for conduct.

The difference in behavior was found to be due to the difference in the number of particles working in atoms.
It is on the basis of such behavioral differences that the species and number of species of atoms can be determined.
Man tried to determine. There are 08 species of atoms on this earth.
Claim humans have made so far and hope to discover the atom of the species
Has happened.

By understanding the atom in this way, we humans become clear in our system-centric mindset.
Let's go. As a result, it became natural for humans to be ready to recognize the natural order within themselves.
, In this sequence, it became easy for humans to understand humane behavior. From this
Joint expression, communication, revelation of values, character, morality in human tradition, from, to
It is found to be the basis of the system.

Due to this fact, animal world, plant world and mineral world - solid, liquid, rare
All species of mathematics in form have atoms at their core and life is also atomic.

The glory of the structure should be evident in the conduct itself and the conduct itself should be in the form of action.
It was easy.

In the context of atomic composition, it is also clear that atomic parts are close to each other.
They are proved only in coexistence. aloof in boundless leisure (extensive)
Atomic fraction does not prove the intention of the system, hence there is infinite space.
Working in a rotating manner, it keeps searching for another part. eventually he will find someone else
gets incorporated into an atom, or forms a fixed atom with another atomic fragment
, This shows that the system was published only after the formation of the atom.
The conduct is published in the order of publication. This physical, chemical and
Life is evident in the form of activity.

It has become clear that atomic structures are based on more than one part.
It has become clear that the atom of every species remains automatic. their behavior is certain
It happens.

The composition of every atom can be understood in terms of parts working in the core and surroundings.
Is. Whatever fractions are working in the environment, the same number of fractions are present in the middle, more than that.
It is also possible to happen. Circumstances mean the degrees circling around the center.
Is from. There are more than one such environment. These environments decrease when there are more than four and
If it is less than four, there is always a possibility of increase. Such atoms are different
In numerical situations, they exist in the form of their respective species. these atoms
The weight depends on the number of intermediate parts contained in it. weight inherent in this form
When one atom recognizes another atom and comes together, we call it molecule. This way
Molecules are found in solid, liquid and rare forms. Solid formations form large formations like the earth
It has become clear. Liquid substance is considered to be the initial substance of the chemical world. it
Everything happens in a compound manner. There is no human contribution in this, humans only
Studies it. Study is necessary so that comfortable work with them

At the core of physico-chemical activity, only atoms and molecules act.
What happened becomes recognizable. In this way the molecule remains in its form as a continuous arrangement.
Works. Proof of working as a system Next position in the system order

There is a status quo. This is one step. Their dignity lies in their determined conduct.
Having such a certain conduct becomes and remains the basis for further steps.

By the combination of cosmic heat, by the reflection (basis of mutual recognition) effect
Liquid compositions in the form of confirmation element and composition element are found in water. its original form
Is called 'Kai. In contrast to such moss, the creations composed of life cells are unicellular,
It has happened through bicellular and multicellular method. This sequence of development in a composition
It shows. This earth has within itself small and big creations in the form of soil, stone, gem, metal.

Juice is accumulated in the nervous system due to the activity of leaves and roots, as a result life cells
Keeps being made. In this way the creations, the development trend in the creations, is contained in the life cells.
It is clear to stay. The proof of this is the diversity in the compositions. currently found
Various creations are testimony to the evolution in creation. In this sequence till human anatomy

3. Development in Nuclear

Before this the evolution in the compositions has become clear. This evolution of atoms, molecules,
Development in creation of molecular bodies, plant world, animal body, human body etc.
The order has been clarified. The human body is amenable to study as the most highly developed creation.

The human body is the most developed creation because the medhas creation in the human body is completely
Has developed. Revelation of facts related to human justice, religion and truth from the distant past
Has been willing to do. All the experiments that have been done in this sequence and further understanding
The need to develop remained. Idealistic, Materialistic in order of efforts
Wisdom came into use. The result has been calculated in human total.

Even today the expectation of justice remains strong in most human beings.

In order to understand existence as coexistence, to express
Effort is presented for. In creations based on existence itself coexistence
The evolution became clear. It is clear that atoms are at the root of every creation. in atoms
It is also understandable for there to be progress and development.

Development in the atom means the formation of the atom. one thing in human
The desire is there - the status quo, the glory, its continuity - it is accepted as natural.
, We have understood the nature of the result of the occurrence and increase of particles in atoms. Result
Instead of the immortality of the soul, its continuity, the imagination, sense, feeling, feeling are present in the human being itself.
Is found in the form. It is natural for this to take a lot of effort. coexistenceist
It has become clear from the method that in the course of development, many creations, situations and circumstances
Has become visible. It has become clear that atoms are at its core. As such

As a result, it has become easy to understand atoms in hungry and indigestion positions.
Undigested atoms keep trying to expel some of the particles contained in their constitution.
Such atoms are endowed with radioactive splendor. Radioactivity can be thought of as
That the reactivity in atoms is always maintained, as a function of reactivity
Sound, heat, electricity are produced automatically. as a result of getting wet in a broad object
Maintain energy prosperity and strength prosperity. This force is present in the form of magnetic force.
Is countable. Therefore, dissipative atoms continue to express heterogeneity in their formation.
Because there remains an effort to exclude some parts of its constitution. in this order
In this case the radioactivity is acquired in such a way that in the undigested atom the radiation towards the midpoints
There is internal transfer of heat. Electricity also remains in this sequence. both these processes
As a result, radioactivity remains visible.

There is always a possibility of the hungry atoms absorbing some more particles.
Is. That is why it is called hungry atom. Indigestion and hunger in atoms are the same as in satiated atoms.
It is understandable only in its meaning (human is the only one to study it). such a satisfied atom
That is, only atoms that are satisfied with their formation are found to be in the life stage. consequential, constitutive
Force and power in atoms become inexhaustible. Inexhaustibility means that no matter how much
Express, spend, it does not decrease. No matter how much hope, thought, desire, evidence
Express, does not diminish, and continues to intensify. That's why it is named Akshay. Such
Every human being can recognize the inexhaustibility within himself by testing it.

Man is the only entity in existence that can study itself and
Can also study the whole. Due to this glory, man as his status and prestige
Being in the state of knowledge has been made clear. Every man and woman have equal glory in the state of knowledge. This only
There is a formula of mutual equality. To forget this sutra is a sign of confusion.

There are tendencies in the work of studying, understanding and validating it.
In this way, the destination of development in atoms is the formational phase.

From the above method it has become clear that physical action, chemical action, life
Atoms are at the root of action. Life is composed of atoms and consists of physical and chemical reactions.
Atoms are constitutive by participating. weight binding, molecular binding by conformation method
is found. At the same time, life is found to be free from atomic weight restrictions and molecular bonds.
The proof of this is the physical realization of the hope, thought, desire, resolution and evidence inherent in every human being.
The inability to calculate and number on the scale is inevitable. Physical balance is a measure of weight
To recognize. It is clear from this testimony that only physical atoms undergo evolution.
It is understandable to human beings that the transition to the formed stage has taken place. in another way
The atom itself is inert in the constitutive state and conscious in the constitutive state. development without evolution
is not studied at all. Conscious atom, (life itself) as tradition, evolution,
The developed post, Jagriti Krama, is found studying and validating Jagriti.
On the basis of this fact, there is a system of proving awakening in human tradition itself, i.e.
The arrangement for human tradition to become glorious only through awakening has been made by destiny. destiny
Meaning of method is co-existence, splendor of existence, method, process, result, result, its
It is from continuity.

It is considered extremely dangerous for the environment. This shows that such mineral coal
The huge forests at the root of which are today visible in the form of coal after getting buried in the earth, due to such burial
The forests of earlier times have digested the same matter within themselves, making it their food.
Skyscraper trees must have remained. The hypothesis of such astromagnetism being present in the earth
It is natural to do this based on the thickness of the mineral coal. At present, somewhere
There is a layer of coal 50 to 80 meters thick. It can be inferred from this
How many big trees there must have been. To have one meter of coal, it takes at least ten meters of trees.
Length of which is required, its density can be understood by all through mathematical method.
Are. In this way, how big a forest of trees must have been to produce such immense coal, mathematically
It can be removed only through method. Very difficult to fit into general concept
Yes, the only hypothesis that can be brought is that there must have been dense forests. such forests
There must have been coal buried under the ground for hundreds of thousands of years, the same forest is filled with deadly air.
Must have been digesting (carbon monoxide), now it is producing carbon monoxide.
Does. Now plants digest carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. all this
It has become known to the wise and scientists. We are mentioning this here because
What is its purpose for this earth?

We have understood that coal and carbon absorb heat.
Absorbs maximum atmospheric heat into itself. use it like this
We can ship coal in one place and white in another place.
Give. In strong sunlight, if you step on the place where there is coal, it feels hot and white.
It feels less hot where the grandson lives. The situations between these two can also be seen in other
Can be seen in places. This shows that coal absorbs maximum heat.
Digests within itself. Delivers slowly. From this evidence we understand that
That the cosmic heat reaching this earth, most of it solar heat, reaches this earth
But there was a need to digest. Because the Earth needs to maintain its heat balance
Only after this, greenery remained safe on the earth's surface. Only after the greenery is safe

In this way we arrive at the fact that similar to the vibrational motion of the earth

More than that, life vibrates in the air and as a result creations are visible on this earth. all this is like this

And the point of frustration has become clear. Many people wish good luck even when they are frustrated with their hair.
Must have wanted. If we try to reason with the auspicious method, then all good will be the pole.
Is. Now here the desire of all good is accepted by all human beings or accepted by the most.
Considering this, in order to further think, understand, present evidence, this article
Have taken it forward.

Among all the methods that have been called science till now, the following are

For human use. It is suitable for use by humans only, who
Is the most powerful. That is, those who assault, loot, murder, terrorize others,
Commits murder. There can be further argument in this, has science declared this somewhere?
Have done. The Declaration of Science is not in the form of a document. Jo-jo in the sense of science
Have gone to live, that is, have composed the arrangements in the form of their opinion citing science,
This type of mention is found in them.

The main declaration in this is uncertainty, instability, the point is clear from it - Science
The scientist is independent in himself, not the scientist. Confirmation of this fact is found in scientific documents.
The question here is – is the responsibility of science the book or the human being? book in this order
What is in the form of a document, what will be certified later by the instrument is the truth, final
Even if it is not true, such a belief has been established. Its conclusion was that the instrument itself
It was the main proof. With this method, responsibility was imposed not on humans but on machines. In this
The convenience of human thinking can be that it does not create complications of logic. of logic
Only humans will do the experiment. There can be no logic with machines, because whatever the machine does,
Keeps doing it again and again. Thus, repeating it again and again is the basis of belief or
Considered the basis of trust. Thus human responsibilities according to science activities
Is away from. Whereas human beings make machines.

In the situation of observation test we find that every human being is in favor of responsibility.

4. Force-power (position-motion)

We humans have been making a lot of speculations about force and power from the past.
After the advent of modern science, experiments were conducted to draw further conclusions about power.
Went. Till now the complete conclusion has not been reached from science discipline, nothing for humanity
Turns out no, this is a point worth considering. In this context, pressure is considered as force from scientific perspective.
An attempt has been made to identify motion, wave and flow as power. a lot of it
Presented all the examples. In the same way as electric wave and magnetic force, the word wave
And in the form of pressure, in the form of waves and pressure in flow, from these various types
An attempt was made to conduct a study. In all these it was found that intermediation
The fact of existence has been denied. All these studies are based on charged motion only. temperament
The question always arises as to where the force and power go when it is in motion.

From the perspective of intermediate philosophy on this issue it appears that in the situation force, motion
Power is manifested in. This means that in order to prove the effect on others
The power in the form of mechanical process is introduced and identified. depending on the circumstances
Is recognisable. There are many ways in which humans can test this fact or theory.

When we go to pick up a stone, we pick it up, then whatever awareness of the combination between us and the stone arises.
Whatever happens as per our understanding, it is called load. This weight of the earth by itself
The coexistence formula is found in the meaning of proving. the same thing, this kind of
It is clear that every human being experiences weight. Like an empty pitcher, fill it with water
If it is filled with soil or filled with potatoes or grains, then pick it up. upon lifting
What it feels like is called weight. Every human being should be the embodiment of negativity within himself.
How to measure or weigh weight on the basis of and imaginative, independent of action
Well, thought about it and found the answer. The method of weighing was decided. to measure
Decided the method. Bigger than that, to weigh the weight of even bigger trucks and trains, etc.

Made a measuring instrument. Every person sees this every day. full weight with earth
The arrangement that takes place in order to prove coexistence is a principle. load in this manner
Being alive is found through coexistence. Every unit is full of force in position, in motion
Publish certified power.

In this sequence it is understood that every object is in its own right distance.
Maintains order. Like more than one atomic fraction in an atom at a fixed distance
While living in the world, the system along with its essence is manifested in the form of conduct, the observer of which is the human being.
, If the distance increases between such fixed good distances then the nucleus in the atom becomes
The intermediary action, which is working, uses its force and calls the parts closer.
Even if the atomic fraction starts coming closer to the central part operating in the middle, the middle part will still remain in its position.
By applying force the part is fixed at a good distance. It occurs in atoms
Control is action. Due to these actions, mutual distance is controlled. atoms, molecules
When they are present in this form, mutual attraction force and magnetic force are present on the basis of mid-sections only.
Is implemented on the basis of. As a result, one atom joins with another atom and forms a molecular bond.
Including are called molecules. It is natural for such molecules to be rich in weight. of same weight
Due to this, there is a tendency for one molecule to join with another molecule while remaining at a certain good distance.
Lives. Due to such tendencies, atoms, molecules, large objects composed of molecules and bodies are formed by human beings.
Present in front, like this earth. All the things connected to the earth along with the earth,
Till the atmosphere, coexistence with solid-solid, with liquid-liquid, with rare-sparse
Certifies. For this, the arrangements made by the earth and its constituent objects,
They are called falling from above, running, flying etc. All the same things fall down from above,
Which exists in the form of solid and liquid. Proves coexistence with liquid-liquid object
The arrangement that one makes out of eagerness to do something is called rain or flow. This 
Thus, the solid object that falls from above is the configuration with the earth, which is
This has the effect of proving the coexistence of the object with the Earth. corresponding configuration
Is named gravity. Actually it is of solid object, with solid object
The very arrangement is to prove coexistence. This is respectful acceptance.

The concept of big and small runs in gravity. In coexistence it has been observed that
Each one is complete with its environment. There is no difference between small and big in this. confirmation of this
This is due to the fact that each one is a system with its own essence. These two principles are nature
It is seen to be accomplished as a result of the combination of speed and determined conduct. in the same order
As a result of everything being part of this earth, everything has to co-exist with the earth.
To obey is a natural tendency. The configuration of this trend extends to the Earth's atmosphere.
Remaining modest is found. This earth is also complete including its environment. in entirety
All the parts and components included in it are found to be in harmony with the whole.
Limited means proving a certain intention through a certain configuration. This way
Definite intent solid - with solid, liquid - with liquid, rare - with sparse
Coexistence has to be proved. Whatever happens in order to prove coexistence
There is also action, we call it configuration. Its function is proof of coexistence
, Through this method the understanding that coexistence is existence is complete.

There is a sense of big and small in relativity. Perfection disappears. in entirety
Only then can each one be respected and evaluated. such appreciation and respect
It is only human who knows the prestige. When humans coexist with perfection
Each certifies the other, in such a situation man moves towards his own perfection.
Paying attention is found to be natural. On the contrary, with the relative method, from smaller to larger
Gets attention. It becomes a necessity to consider oneself great. to maintain it
Therefore, keeping others small also becomes a necessity. Treason in this sequence,
Revolt, exploitation, starvation, artillery, all the tasks are accomplished. when there is communication about

Positional motion in its nature is a combined form of pressure and flow. in some examples

This is never going to stop. These activities and publications have always been present.
That is why human is presented as a unit capable of studying all these. That's why myself too
Man has to prove his participation in the system in position and in the overall system in motion.
Only then is the evidence of mental health presented in tradition. In humans without mental health
It is not possible to have a comprehensive solution. That is why mental health is important for humans.

Many planetary spheres are capable of studying even cosmic rays. of all these
Gratitude has become available to humans. At the same time, the study of humans for humans

Have made it clear. Therefore, understanding the expanse of the earth, it is important to maintain seasonal balance.
For this, loyalty, inclination and activism are necessary.

Country

We know this expansion as the country. According to the prevailing law, many countries
The name has been recognized. If we think honestly, the expansion of any one creation
There is a country. Like, this earth itself has a certain expanse. the earth itself, no
So it is divided, not disintegrated. The integrity of this earth is known to all.
, Despite this, efforts have been made to divide it in the name of many countries and states. This
The earth being unbroken, the humans on this earth themselves as a united society.
There is also an inspiration to recognize. Only after humans recognize their integrity, this earth
But the possibility of human being being safe arises. As long as humans remain disintegrated, the earth will
There is a possibility of continuing to suffer damage. Therefore, the earth being a creation in itself,
All the units existing in an indivisible form in the creation are connected with the integrity of the earth.
, Similarly, every creation, every earth's creation is a complete unit in itself. such an unbroken earth
We can recognize this earth as an example of. all four states on earth should be certified
Well, this is the meaning of developed earth or developing earth. on this basis
Man becomes aware of the creation of this earth and its glory. human being by integrity method
In, from, for, united society, system of studying and certifying the universal system.

Every plant, animal and human being on this earth is a creation. all these from the earth
Also there is splendor. All these are one period of creation. Every earth, tree, plant, creature
Animals are evidence of human creation in the past period. All these are based on their respective periods.
But the periods are certified. Like the length, breadth and height of the earth are measured

Mutual complementarity and usefulness become self-evident.

It is on the basis of composition that the matter of deconstruction and re-construction becomes clear. Earth
Creation in itself, in the sense of its continuity, helps to explain development in the course of evolution and
Exists in the sense of clarifying awakening. Because, all four states on this earth
Have been certified. The earth remains limited by its creation. all states on this earth
And the position has been certified, it has become present in zero attraction. If composed on this basis
When complete splendor is accomplished, these four stages appear. all four stages
The glory and dignity of this earth has become clear. Like, all four states on earth
If they were not there, then there would be no human being either. Humans, after being born, commit anti-earth acts out of delusion
Have done. At the same time, we should consciously adapt to this earth i.e. development and awakening.
In order to authenticate, humans organize themselves, authenticate, work
It is necessary and appropriate to clarify the behavior.

direction and vision

In relation to direction, a human standing facing the sun can look forward, backward, right, left.
It is popular to recognize direction in form. It has also been given names - East, West, North,
In the south, this is also prevalent. After this, about the original origin and purpose of Disha
Thinking was a natural activity. Every issue co-exists, from, to, determined by
is found to be. Thus, it is natural for the direction to be determined in the sense of coexistence.
Is. Coexistence always involves complementarity and usefulness. Direction in this order
To recognize it, it is necessary to recognize someone in pole form. like earth to man
We recognize it as the pole. One point becomes the center of many parts. from the center
An angle is formed by connecting two degrees at some distance with a straight line. By this method each
The existence of an infinite angle can be understood only by the combination of fractions.
It becomes clear.

In this way, every object has a central point, every central point has infinite parts connected to it.

, As by spreading the first 45 degrees far and wide in unison, 8 directions are visible on all sides of an object.
Becomes Similarly, by division method of 90 degrees, 4 directions are formed, 80 degrees
On division, 2 directions are formed. Thus, one of the things to determine direction
This can be understood by the method of having centers of many parts. The second method is this,
We already know about the second object in front, the Sun in front of the Earth. both these modes
The angle from (a centre) is clear on the basis of degrees. Because the sun and the moon
It is the center of the infinite part. Whenever the direction is determined on the basis of the sun,
Will be at 90 degrees or 80 degrees. Made on the basis of recognizing 90 degree direction
It is made on the basis of 80 degree visibility.

We have recognized man as the observer. towards which the human gaze
When running, he turns only 90 degrees with both the eyes, this is called Drishti Pat. 90
The beginning of the fraction is at the point. This point is right behind both the eyes, on the nerves of both the eyelids.
It happens only at the joining place, it is established in the Medhas system only, physical chemical
It remains established in the form of a system. Chashlu system including its chemical composition system and vitality
Remains active with mentality. This means that human (life)
It is only in presence that one can talk about sense of direction, time etc. by mechanical method
Also, if we do verbs related to direction and time, then all the verbs mentioned earlier will also be used in that.
They always remain related to humans. Therefore, at the root of mechanical proof is human proof. self proof
Human is also at the root of this, because human is the authenticating unit. book proof
The human being is the proof at its core also. Thus, in order to understand the human proof method
It is also important to understand the human circulatory system.

The optic disc extends 90 degrees into the visual system of every human being. This 
Its expansion occurs when all the objects coming in the field of vision remain at a certain good distance.
Perception is achieved through the visual system. The process of realization happens in life itself. also by Chaklu Tantra
It is understandable on the basis of human life and body being indivisible. such splendor
Prosperity is a necessary process. This can be identified through research in every human being.

The distance also increases. In this sequence, the optic nerve is identified. It is also clear,
It is also accepted. Degree, angle, extension, distance, all these are facts accessible to human vision?
That is why, keeping human vision as the basis, a method is created to identify every fact.

After identifying the three poles on the basis of understanding, angles are formed by connecting the poles to the poles.

Along with this, heat is also related to the earth. earth and all atoms in the earth
Is affected, in such a situation and the other sources are the radiation sources of cosmic activities.
As a result, there is only a transmission of radiation emitted or transmitted from many earths.
It is still built. Along with this, the earth is rich in atoms of many species.
At the base, there is a lot of radioactive material working in this earth also. In this manner,
The combination of radiation and heat has been the background for the entire compound reaction to take place. compound
Events, starting from the occurrence of water, to the occurrence of compound events in the form of acid and alkali.

And as the element of creation is glorious in itself, the creation of Prana Sutra and Prana Sutra is the same.
Thermal combination, radiation due to vibration, respiratory process including the method of composition in Prana Sutras.

For such creations to be diverse, it is understandable that the method of creation is accepted in the Prana Sutras.
After one type of creation becomes prosperous in itself, the life for another type of creation becomes available.

Even in form, while the species remained the same, whatever greatness was to be achieved, it happened. In this

In this, curiosity is created about the tendency in the Prana Sutras for diversity in composition -
Why does it happen, how does it happen? The need to think about this issue comes naturally to humans.
The main issue is color and form, in which there is diversity. Any particular part of the body parts
