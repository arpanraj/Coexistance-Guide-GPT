Question: What is meant by transparency of knowledge?

Answer: I am sitting right here, I have just told you all the past.

Is there transparency or not? from empirical knowledge of all the past
The review has been done, should this be called transparency of knowledge or not? I
I am sitting here, have not gone out into the world, have not collected information from anyone.

Got it. I also understood why it exists.
Based on experience in co-existence I know everything in existence

Should it be considered as evidence or not?

By studying, I have acquired the knowledge of total existence. Modern
What is the significance of worldly education, which is not there in my philosophy?
Has she come? Should this be considered transparency of knowledge or not?

When I go to see any event, I see that event.
The situation is understandable, even more than that
Is. I reach the solution to that incident or situation.
Should this be considered transparency of knowledge or not? in me
This ability is attained after attaining the spiritual practice and samadhi with restraint.
Came. Before that I did not have this ability. This ability is all
For that, it is proposed to study intermediate philosophy.

Question: What was the benefit of transparency of knowledge?

Answer: This gives clear justice to the negative and positive.
It happens. The positive part comes in “living” the human being. negative
Part goes into crime. I called the negative part “guilt”.
Have given. Both negative and positive events in elemental form
Are only. There is no sequence in negative events. Positive
The events keep getting linked one to the other, second to the third.
This is the difference between these two.

Question: What is meant by transferability of knowledge?

Answer: On the basis of understanding in myself when I know the meaning of existence
When I present an explanation, you feel a desire to understand.
Knowledge is transferred from one person to another. this is the knowledge
There is evidence of permeability. This is my model. model of life
It happens to the body, doesn't it? It is a model of experiential knowledge.
this is gospel. Scientists who are engaged in making models of the body,
Just imagine how useless it is!

Question: What was the benefit of transferability of knowledge?

Answer: This eliminated the method of gratitude. to the understood
To explain, to teach what has been learned, to get what has been done is a favor.
Is. There is transferability of knowledge only when one person understands it.
May be able to explain. There is transitivity of knowledge only then
So universalization of knowledge is possible through education method.

When a person appears before me, why is he like this?
I immediately understand what is being presented. then him

Only then is this possible.

Only through knowledge can one attain freedom from human illusion, freedom from oneself and others.
One gets freedom from crime. To put it positively, all human beings
Have to be recognized as a caste. “The human race is one.”
This recognition can be done only through experiential knowledge. and someone
If it can be made using the method then please tell! “The human race is one” it
If it is possible to identify it by any machine, then tell me! "The human race is one
Is it possible to identify this secret by any method, then please tell!

Experience in co-existence is knowledge. nature in power
The answer to why and how there is physical existence is self-evident.

Gave methods of measurement at macro and micro level, through which work could be done.

Happiness was not recognized by both idealism and materialism.
If you can have this decision then you will be free from them (past),
Otherwise (the past) will continue to hold on!

“Man wants to be happy.” This is the point of Indian Spiritualism.
Gave. “There is no continuity of happiness in the senses.” This also

We understood the nature of motion in atoms. as a result of motion
There is sound, there is heat, there is electricity. heat, sound
And the basic form of electricity is at the atomic level.

Due to being enriched in power, atomic particles are endowed with magnetic force.
A magnetic field is formed between the ambient particles and the nucleus,
Which produces electricity through fission due to its nuclear rotational motion.
Is. There is no identity of electricity in atomic fragments alone.

Sound due to mutual friction of atomic particles in the atmosphere

Similarly, if two objects stay together in a system, heat is produced.

Nature is speed. Due to disorder the temperature increased or decreased.

Sound, heat and electricity are expressed only in mutuality,

Experience can be narrated.

In the method of study, the understanding of “nature immersed in being” is in the intellect itself.
It happens. This cannot be depicted in the mind of the person studying.
This can be understood only in the intellect.

Question: What is the difference between depiction and perception?

Answer: The understanding that occurs in the intellect is achieved through the empirical method.
The proof is presented. And the depiction that occurs in the mind without awareness is
It is not certified, it is expressed as a feeling. illustration
And this is the difference in understanding.

There must be some word too. language also to express understanding

Because it creates pain in you. That is already happening in you.
If pain is created for the sake of experience, loyalty will be created for the sake of experience.
Where man stands now, he is in favor of telling more, of understanding.
Not in favor. That's why I say tell him the right thing,
Gradually there will be curiosity to make it one's own. now you and me
We are talking on the basis of that curiosity. to create ownership
If the pain in the form of curiosity increases, then its solution should be natural.
