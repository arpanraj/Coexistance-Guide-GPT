In our family tradition, top class scholars, service minded and
Hard-working behavior and work practice were easy, out of which
Hard work and service tendencies got me scholarship
There should be question marks in favor.

The first question that arose was -

The origin of the world and the living beings from the truth of Brahma is false.
How?

other question -

- How is Brahma the cause of bondage and salvation?

Third question -

- Word proof or bearer bearer proof of the word?

Democracy - in the election process of public representatives in governance

Of the “persistence” or “mediation” of every state of nature.
There is a form by which the tradition of that state is maintained.

It is a complete thing. Life is in coexistence. in coexistence
Life is knowledge. Humanity exists only in coexistence. in coexistence

Answer: Studying from word to meaning and from meaning to object.
It is necessary to reach. the studious realization of truths in experience
What happened gets accepted. acceptance in experience
Authenticity came when it happened. as a result of which there is evidence in the intellect
Realization occurs. To prove which intellect, mind, instinct, mind
Everyone starts working.

The supremacy (originality) of intelligence is understanding. dominance of mind
It is just contemplation. Dominance of instincts, comparison based on justice, religion, truth
It is only there. The supremacy of the mind is to taste the values. in the manner
The whole life becomes “experience full”.

Through study method one reaches acceptance in experience, experience
Till they get certified through the original method. who studied
To authenticate it.

Becoming certified begins with experience-based thinking.
Before that there is Drishtapad. Through experience, man becomes an observer.
Is. Getting certified is just a part of living as a tradition.

Experience occurs only when realization has occurred. Except “right”
There is no sense of anything. Anything other than “right” is human.
Comes in front of, logic gets trapped in it. As long as “rightness”
Until the human being comes forward with the proposal of logic, he is in its clutches.
Keeps me trapped. “Rightness” does not come under the grip of logic.
Only then does one realize the rightness. existence in coexistence
Understanding occurs in the intellect. Coexistence is the ultimate truth hence experience
It happens. Experience in coexistence only after realizing coexistence
It happens. Even in the sadhana (samadhi) that I go through with restraint,
It was only after I became aware of coexistence that I experienced it.

Experience comes only after the study is completed. object of study

छशज्ज्ञान्जा4ते1540.08


<newpage>

Existential Human Centered Thinking /485

It is complete coexistence. If study is completed then certified
The experience comes immediately with the determination to do. only by experience
The thirst for validation is instantly quenched. completion of study
There is a readiness to be certified in the situation.

If there is experience in the soul, we prove ourselves
Became capable of doing.

Proof is obtained only through empirical method. any other proof
Doesn't happen.

Proof is obtained through empirical method only. something else would happen
Not there. Experience is the final proof. getting certified without experience
The status will not come.

The form of revelation of experience is justice, religion, truth. the last
What it boils down to is “we have to let live and we have to live.” Let it happen, as soon as it happens
Have to stay.”

Tell me, what argument will you make in this? Every life justice, religion, truth
Wants to. Children are seekers of justice from birth, right
Want to behave at work and are truth tellers. every child
The seeker of justice is to establish justice dispensing capability in it.
There is a need. Every child wants to behave properly.
There is a need to practice actions and behavior. every child
Truth is the speaker (he speaks as he sees and hears) in that
There is a need to realize the truth.

The “tendency” to be certified is definitely there in humans! to be certified
“Need” is there in humans! but to be certified
Humans did not yet have the “understanding of realities”, it was clear that
To do this is the study of intermediate philosophy.

Unless there is experience, the problem of logic remains.

Development and awakening are certain. To live only these three things

Philosophy, religion and scriptures have been written. When the complete text is condensed into five sutras

Development in evolution, awakening in coexistence, order and awakening in coexistence.

Expression is the process of living through experience based method,
Communication and publication. In these three ways human beings express their experiences.
Presents in living. Publishing is more of an interpretation of the experience.
There is limited interpretation in communication. The expression has a brief explanation.
Interpretation takes place according to the authority of the person in front. of study
The goal is to move from detail to conciseness. be self evident
Go. Nothing more than this happens. imagine more than this
also cannot be done. Human knowledge is based on imagination
It happens. Rules, control, balance, justice, religion, truth in these 6 dimensions
This is the limit of human being being certified. It's not more than that.

You will understand this completely and live as good as me.
Or you will live better than me! Your imagination and freedom of action
If you connect with this understanding then you will definitely become better than us! before this
Neither materialism could think like this, nor idealism could think like this.
Materialism died in reservation and specialization. idealism
Got trapped in mystery. Intermediate philosophy between these two

In the order of development by law, as is, with completeness and essence.
Staying prosperous is achieved through systematic methods. these substances

Human anatomy took place only after the formations were cyclical.
The order of occurrence and method of reproduction has been seen in the form of lineages.
Humans recognized this as “race” and “color”.

By the above method the whole existence comes into existence and activities take place.
By “staying” in the form, there is a sequence of development, evolution, awakening, awakening.
It became clear that existence in form was “present”. perfect present coexistence
Is swaroopi. Coexistence is rooted in the wider in its nature
Consciousness is nature. In this way, being in action and form is the present.
It is only human who can understand this. certifier also only
He is human only.

Recognizing the four stages as a “system” is human

From ancient times to today, war is a necessity in everyone's mind.

The issue of my speech today is “universal system”. Sovereign
How is the arrangement? Proposal before you in the last three days
It has been said that in the form of “option” there is a need to be endowed with ‘wisdom’.
Needed. To 'certify' after being 'intelligent'
is required. It appears before humans in the form of “necessity”.
is putting. Till the year 2000, there will be knowledgeable, ignorant and scientists on this earth.
Whatever you thought, decided, did results in this
The earth was seen becoming sick. The distance between our own and others' increases
It was seen that it happened. Terrorism increasing on the borders of countries
Got to see. After seeing all this there is a reason to think in mankind
The issue emerged “Are we doing it right, or are we doing it wrong?”

In response to that, this statement of “wisdom” in alternative form
is proposed. Wisdom is called existence philosophy knowledge, life knowledge and
To make humane conduct accessible to study in a combined form of knowledge
Gave arrangement for. Today there are about 2000 people studying it.
People are already there. Now if you wish, you can also study.

The earth itself became sick, necessitating reconsideration.
“Wisdom” is proposed as an alternative for reconsideration.

Without these three knowledge, we will never be “wise”.
Not even now, not even after millions of years. test this knowledge

The man who died, the man who died tomorrow, everyone wants to be happy.
Every person has the solution when he is endowed with human consciousness.

All human beings want happiness. Want to live happily.
How can they become wise, resolved, certified in just one journey through the body?
There is arrangement for the entire study within that framework. same body journey
In! There is no question of multiple body journeys. in the same body journey
Can study “the whole thing”.

“The whole thing” is the study of existence in coexistence form.
Let it be done and study yourself. Then the complete study took place.
By leaving out even one part, the complete study was not done.
