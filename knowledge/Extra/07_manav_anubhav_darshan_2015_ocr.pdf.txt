Option

, Vs physical-chemical object-centric ideas based on instability and uncertainty
Human beings could not be studied through scientific method. mystical idealistic thinking
Human beings could not be studied even through methods. In both types of promises, the human being
It has been called a living being.

As an alternative philosophy mediated by existential human centered thinking method,
In co-existence, humans were recognized and made to be in a state of knowledge.

According to intermediate philosophy, human being is the knower (knower), existence in the form of co-existence
The thing worth knowing and accepting, i.e. the complete thing to know, this is philosophy, knowledge.
Along with this, coexistence is proved along with knowledge of life and humane conduct.
The study of the method of being has become accessible.

Existential based human centered thinking knowledge, intermediary philosophy, coexistence-
It has been presented by me before humans for study in the form of scriptures.

2. Before existential human centered thinking, my (A. Nagaraj, Agrahar Nagaraj,
District Hassan, Karnataka State, India) Initiation Spiritualist Knowledge Vedic Thoughts Sahaj
Worship was done through action.

3. According to Vedanta, knowledge 'Brahma is true, the world is false whereas the living world is derived from Brahman.
Origin explained.

Worship :- In reference to Gods and Goddesses.
Karma:- All the deeds that lead to heaven (in the form of language).
In Manu Dharma Shastra:- Daily work of four varnas and four ashrams is proposed.

In rituals. :- Sixteen types of rituals from pregnancy to death rituals
Valid and their programs are there.

After studying all this a question arose in my mind that -
4... Satyam Jnanam Anantam How is the living world arising from Brahman false? The Vedic scholars of the time

And in order to inquire with the scholars, I :-

In Samadhi one got the assurance of knowing the unknown. basis of support from scriptures
But it was accepted to complete the work of Sadhana, Samadhi and Samyama. I have done sadhana, samadhi,
Study of the entire existence as co-existence, living in a state of samyama,
Completed by the method of experience, the understanding obtained which resulted in intermediate philosophy
The alternative appeared in the form of coexistence.

5. Based on idealistic scriptures and mystical God-centered thinking knowledge and tradition.
According to- Knowledge latent, inexpressible.

According to Madhyaya Darshana - Knowledge is expressed and can be understood through verbal study method,
Through practical method, the proof became clear as being accessible to all.

6. Instability, uncertainty in object-centric thinking according to materialism.
Science was considered as knowledge in which the rules were also said to be made by man.
Is. Its alternative is human-centered thinking knowledge based on existence in the form of coexistence.
According to this, existence is stable, development and awakening are certain, the whole law is natural.
To be, to remain is propounded.

7. Existence is not just physical and chemical but also physical, chemical and life things.
This is the indivisible present in the wider object. Mediator philosophy, co-existence
There is a scripture sutra.

8. From where I started my physical journey, my ancestors were called Vedamurthy. in home and village
Vedas and ideas related to Vedas, Upanishads and philosophy are the language, sound and tune.
I kept coming to listen. Vedic worship in family tradition
The work continued to be completed.

9. In our family tradition, top class scholars, service oriented and hardworking behavior practices.
And the practice of work was easy, from which I accepted hard work and service tendencies.
Happened. There were question marks on the scholarship side.

0. The first question that emerged was -
How can the origin of the world and the living beings from Brahman Truth be false?
other question -
How is Brahma the cause of bondage and salvation?
Third question -
Word proof or word holder carrier proof?
Evidence of object sentence or evidence of origin of object sentence?
Scriptural evidence or pioneer evidence?
Another question arose in the expedient situation
Fourth question -

After independence in India, the Constituent Assembly was formed in which nation, nationality,
The formula of national character is not explained and the people's representative deserves to be eligible.
Approval should be in the constitution.

What kind of mandate and public representative is there from Vote-Note (Dhan) alliance?

Secularism in the Constitution - one sentence and with it many castes, sects,
Mention of community.

Equality in the Constitution – one sentence, with the same mention of reservation and the Constitution
To have his process in.

4/ Mediated philosophy (existential human centered thinking)

Nature is a collection of infinite units.

The growth and decline of each unit depends on the relative force generated by its motion.
It is based on the process of internalization and externalization.

Internalization of power is awakening (development).
Basic unit means atom.
In the context of development, unit means atom.

Awakening and illusion only until one is endowed with capacity, capability and eligibility to realize Brahman.
The possibility remains.

Freedom from illusion is to be endowed with full capability, capability and eligibility to realize the Brahman.
The conscious unit is freed from the need of taste of matter and is in lovingness or power.
To experience is salvation. Kindness, kindness and compassion combined together is love.

Brahmanubhuti, understanding, spontaneous pleasure is the neglect of the pleasure of taste in the five senses.
Which is called renunciation.

Continuity in experiencing spontaneous bliss, experiencing Brahman is an innate fundamental characteristic which is more,
Is free from scarcity and scarcity. Experience, spontaneous expression is complete feeling, completeness and proof.
Is.

Helping in the awakening of unawakened human units, illusion-free and awakened human beings
Is the nature of units.

The term moksha itself is eternal, the other terms are impermanent.
Bliss is a natural continuation in the state of salvation itself. Not in any other position.

The soul is naturally desired - it is experienced in (Brahm). Therefore, the soul from itself
Indivisible, not affected by intellect, mind, instinct and mind.

Soul is the mediating action and Brahma is the mediating power.
The soul is not affected by even-odd action and power.
The soul itself is Ishta Brahma in I and I.

Brahma knowledge is not obsolete, its inaccessibility and non-reputation. this only
It is characterized by lack of proper rights (ability, capability, eligibility).

Mere lack of understanding of what exists does not prove to cause any harm to it or to it.
It does not happen.

Of the qualities, nature, religion and proper behavior of the things found in existence.
Through study and knowledge-based practice, the ability to realize Brahman is developed.

Is.

Brahma is the truth, coexistence is the ultimate truth, experience in coexistence is the solution,
Solution is equality, equality is happiness, happiness is proof of experience. experience is behavior
And experiment is easy proof. Production equality as per rules, treatment equality justly,
Equanimity of thoughts, dharma (solution), equality of experience, Brahman is visible in its natural comprehensiveness.

Is.

Results and refinements in the state of objects, actions, compositions and behaviors at all times
Busy for further development and awakening. Brahman, power, natural existence, country-blackness
Is. Man is changeable, he has rights and disqualifications, qualifications and disqualifications.
Relatively, it is meant and expressed through process.

All atoms, planets, constellations etc. are included in Brahma and are connected to Brahma.

Every unit is constitutively a unit. All of each fraction contained in each formation
And there is Brahma. Brahma is transcendent in every unit and part.

Comprehensive power is absolute which has many nouns.
Sky and void are also natural nouns of Brahma.
Till the realization of Brahman, no human being is free from change.

The basic goal of all the units of the state of knowledge is only the simple realization of Brahman.
It is only there. Brahmanubhooti is the experience of coexistence.

The units of life and state of knowledge as a combined state of matter and consciousness.
Are alive and visible.

The root itself has evolved into consciousness. Consciousness means the atom in itself
One has to become sensitive and cognizant.

Change and modification of hope in the unit of living state, unit of knowledge
The change and modification of hope, thought, desire and resolution is famous in it.

Each conscious unit (conscious atom) is in a cluster with its own sphere of action.

Every conscious unit of the state of knowledge, free from the atomic group, hope, thought,
Full of desire and determination. Therefore it is the cause of bondage and salvation.

The need for taste is towards bondage and the innate curiosity towards Brahman is towards salvation.

Every atom is immersed in Brahman, hence the entire inanimate-conscious nature
It is saturated, controlled, inspired, active and preserved in Brahman. This is why humans are constantly

There is no sense-trading.
